# Todo API

This is a simple RESTful API for managing todo items using ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and MySQL.

## Requirements

- .NET SDK (latest version)
- MySQL server

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TodoApi

- Was it easy to complete the task using AI? 
Sometimes easy, sometimes hard. It depends on prompt and on length of a conversation. Longer then it was harder.

- How long did task take you to complete? (Please be honest, we need it to gather anonymized statistics) 
8 hours, but it could take 5 on secound attempt.
- Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
Not realy, there were many small mistakes that was hard to fix it. The biggest problem was creating tests for repository
- Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?
Not sistematically, Not using Solid even when ordered, problems with configuration of DBContext in Program.cs, Problem with mock and with setups. Many style and complexity problems.
- Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?
Declaring every thing in detail, creating new chat that two was most helpful.
Then put instructions at the beginning of the prompt and use ### or """ to separate the instruction and context and Reduce “fluffy” and imprecise descriptions
